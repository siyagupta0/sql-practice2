- Employees
- Jobs
- Departments
- Dependents
- Locations
- Countries
- Regions

The SQL queries in this project demonstrate how a business analyst can use SQL to analyze employee data, validate business rules, and support decision-making.

## Tools Used

- MySQL Workbench
- SQL (including joins, group by, filters, calculations, date functions)
